1.	Write sql to find an error in delivery date given order and shipment records as follows:

Order
orderID
warehouseID
shipmentID
orderDate
expectedDeliveryDate
destinationState

Shipment
Status ( not shipped | in transit | complete )
shipmentID
shippedDate
deliveredDate

Select * 
From order o 
join shipment s using(shipmentID)
where o.expectedDeliveryDate <= s.deliveredDate
and s.Status IN ("not shipped", "complete")

2.	Give me a count of orders with shipments on both 10/1 and 10/2.

select count(*) 
from order o
inner join shipment s
where s.shippedDate BETWEEN "2021-10-01 00:00:00" AND "2021-10-02 23:59:59"
group by orderid

3.	How would you go about making updates to a very large dataset? 
begin; 
SQL
SQL
SQL
SQLN 
COMMIT


4.	Given the following sample data:
employee_id	date_worked	hours_worked	department
1		1/1/2019	8		123
2		1/1/2019	5		456
3		1/10/2019	8		123
3		1/15/2019	6		456

1.	Give the average hours worked for 2019 by employee.

select avg(hours_worked) 
from employee
where year(date_worked) = 2019
group by employee_id

6.	Give me the SQL to show the 3rd ranked employee by hours worked for January 2019.

2.	Give the total hours worked for the month of December 2019 for each employee 
that did not work the rest of the year.

5.	Design a table to store history for employee department changes.
create table emp_history (
emp_hist_id id auto_increment primary key 
emp_id id int
department varchar()
created_dt datetime
updated_dt datetime
)
